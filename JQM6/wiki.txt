This is a playing around with JQuery Mobile using an example scenario:
//Using a hand-held device (e.g. a web enabled phone) a customer inputs information to the form about their claim: 
- the shipment number from the original receipt, 
- name/address, and 
- a description of loss/damage. 

//When the customer submits the form, 
- the web site responds with a claim id for further tracking.

We want to achieve:
1. Short response time: so we'll design all functionalities on a page
2. Error handling: If the user forgets to enter a required field in the form, submission should fail with a warning dialog. 
3. Support for multiple devices/browsers:

Simple Algorithmic flowchart:
Main Content--->(form submitted) Transition COntent--->(response received)Confirmation content
         |                            |
          |                           |
         ------------------------------
If there is missing content go back to Dialog Content to take you back to main content form.
